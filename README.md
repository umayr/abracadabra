# Abracadabra
> Dark magic to keep you from committing crazy code.

## Usage

In your project root directory, type:
```
  $ npm install --save abracadabra
```

and that's it. 

If you don't have any eslint or jshint configurations in your root directory, it'll ask you and then create a default configuration for linter of your choice. You may later change configurations according to your needs.

It adds a pre-commit hook which will prevent other developers to go crazy on your code.
